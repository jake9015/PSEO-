## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. ❌ **Publishing all 39k pages at once**
   - ✅ Instead: Gradual rollout (500/week max)

2. ❌ **Identical content on every page**
   - ✅ Instead: Use viral hooks rotation, vary features emphasis

3. ❌ **Ignoring page speed**
   - ✅ Instead: Target <3 seconds load time

4. ❌ **No internal linking**
   - ✅ Instead: Every page links to 3-5 related pages

5. ❌ **Not tracking conversions**
   - ✅ Instead: GA4 events on every CTA

6. ❌ **Weak CTAs**
   - ✅ Instead: A/B test CTA copy

7. ❌ **Starting with low-priority patterns**
   - ✅ Instead: Follow the priority order in Top 50 CSV

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Content Variation Tricks:
1. **Rotate viral hooks** - You have 200+ TikTok hooks, use different ones per page
2. **Vary feature emphasis** - Don't always lead with LORA training
3. **Different examples** - Bali photoshoot on page 1, Paris on page 2, etc.
4. **Unique FAQs** - Create 20 FAQ variations, rotate 5 per page

### SEO Optimization:
1. **Target one keyword per page** - Don't try to rank for multiple
2. **Use keyword in first 100 words** - Critical for Google
3. **Internal linking** - Link from high-authority pages to new pages
4. **Schema markup** - Use SoftwareApplication schema on all pages

### Conversion Optimization:
1. **Multiple CTAs** - One in hero, one mid-page, one at end
2. **Social proof** - Stats, testimonials, logos
3. **Urgency** - "Join 1,000+ creators already using Sozee"
4. **Specificity** - "Generate 10,000 photos from 1 shoot" not "Generate more photos"

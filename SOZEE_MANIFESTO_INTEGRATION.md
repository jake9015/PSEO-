## Critical Updates Needed in Agent Prompts

### ❌ **INCORRECT Information in Current Prompts**

**Current (WRONG):**
```
- Custom LORA training: 30 minutes
```

**Manifesto (CORRECT):**
```
- Upload as few as 3 photos
- No training. No waiting. No technical setup.
- Instant likeness reconstruction
```

**Action Required:** Update ALL agent prompts to reflect **3 photos, instant** not "30 minutes LORA training"

---

### 🎯 **New Key Messaging to Add**

#### The Content Crisis Framework
```
Problem → 100:1 Demand Ratio → Creator Burnout → Sozee Solution
```

#### Updated Differentiators
**Replace this:**
- Custom LORA Training in 30 minutes ❌

**With this:**
- 3 photos minimum (instant likeness) ✅
- No training, no waiting, no setup ✅
- Hyper-realistic (indistinguishable from real) ✅
- Private models (never used elsewhere) ✅
- Built for monetization, not AI art ✅

---

## Updated Agent Prompts

### 1. **Copywriting Agent** - CRITICAL UPDATES

**ADD to SOZEE KEY DIFFERENTIATORS:**

```python
**SOZEE KEY DIFFERENTIATORS:**

- **Hyper-Realistic Output** (indistinguishable from real shoots)
- **Total Privacy** (isolated models, never used for training)
- **Monetization-First Design** (not AI art, built for creator businesses)
- 1-Click TikTok Cloning (replicate viral content instantly)

```

**UPDATE BRAND VOICE:**

```python
**BRAND VOICE:**
Direct, confident, slightly edgy. Speak to the Content Crisis and creator burnout.
Use "you" language. Be specific with numbers (3 photos, 100:1 ratio, infinite content).

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "The Content Crisis"
- "100:1 demand ratio"
- "Infinite content engine"
- "From just 3 photos"

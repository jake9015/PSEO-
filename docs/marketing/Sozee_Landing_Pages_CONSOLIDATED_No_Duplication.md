## EXAMPLES OF NON-COMPETING PAGES

User searches "ai photo generator onlyfans":
✅ /onlyfans-ai-photo-generator (Pattern 3 - Direct match)
❌ /ai-photo-generator-onlyfans (REMOVED - would have competed)

User searches "best ai photo generator for onlyfans agencies":
✅ /best-ai-photo-generator-for-onlyfans-agencies (Pattern 2 - Best match)
✅ /onlyfans-ai-photo-generator (Pattern 3 - Related but different intent)
No competition because "best" indicates comparison shopping vs ready to buy

## CANONICAL TAG STRATEGY (If You Must Keep Both)

If you absolutely want to keep Pattern 10 AND Pattern 11:

**Option A: Use Canonical Tags**
- Make Pattern 11 the canonical version
- Pattern 10 pages include: `<link rel="canonical" href="pattern-11-url">`
- This tells Google "these pages are duplicates, index only Pattern 11"

**Option B: Use 301 Redirects**
- Pattern 10 → Redirect to Pattern 11
- Consolidates all link equity and rankings
- Cleaner solution

**My Recommendation:** Just use Pattern 3 (Pattern 11 format). Don't create Pattern 10 at all.

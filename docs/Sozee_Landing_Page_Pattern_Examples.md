### SECTION 2: PROBLEM/HOOK

**Pattern 1: /sozee-vs-higgsfield-for-onlyfans-creators**
```
If you're an OnlyFans creator, you've probably heard about 
Higgsfield. Maybe you've even tried it. But here's the reality: 
Higgsfield is built for AI enthusiasts and developers, not 
creators like you.

The learning curve is steep. The interface is complex. The 
results are inconsistent. You spend more time fighting with 
the tool than actually creating content.

• Complex prompt engineering required
• No NSFW optimization for creator content
• Generic results that don't look like you
• Expensive ($29+/month with limited features)

That's where Sozee is fundamentally different.
```

**Pattern 3: /onlyfans-ai-photo-generator**
```
What if I told you that you could generate 10,000 photos from 
a single 30-minute photoshoot?

Not generic stock photos. Not obvious AI that fans will spot 
immediately. But hyper-realistic photos that look EXACTLY like 
you, in any outfit, any location, any scenario you can imagine.

• Traditional shoots cost $2,000+ and take 4-6 hours
• Content "expires" after 1-2 weeks of posting
• You're always behind, always stressed, always shooting
• One vacation or sick day = revenue drop

Meet the OnlyFans AI photo generator built for creators like you.

### SECTION 2: PROBLEM

**Pattern 2: /best-ai-photo-generator-for-onlyfans-agencies**
```
Every OnlyFans agency asks the same question: which AI photo 
generator actually works?

You've tried Midjourney (too generic). You've tested Higgsfield 
(too complex). You've experimented with Runway (too slow). And 
none of them solve your real problem: scaling content output 
per creator.

Here's what doesn't work:
• Generic AI tools not built for creator content
• Complex workflows that require technical skills
• Results that fans can easily identify as AI
• Tools with no NSFW support

Here's what actually works for OnlyFans agencies...
```

**Pattern 6: /content-crisis-solution-for-onlyfans-agencies**
```
Let's talk about the elephant in the room.

Every OnlyFans agency hits the same ceiling, and it has nothing 
to do with your marketing skills or monetization strategy. It's 
the content bottleneck.

You're 100% dependent on your creators to produce raw material. 
When they don't shoot, you don't have content. When you don't 
have content, you can't post. When you can't post, fans churn 
and revenue drops.

This is the content crisis:
• Industry operates on 1/100 supply vs demand ratio
• Your entire operation grinds to halt without creator content
• One creator vacation = 30-40% revenue drop for that month
• You spend 15+ hours per week begging for content

This is costing you millions in lost revenue.
